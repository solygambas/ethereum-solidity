# Hardhat Demo

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Features

- setting up a React project.
- creating a Ethereum development environment with Hardhat.
- installing MetaMask.
- compiling and deploying a Greeting contract locally.
- writing the front end code.
- deploying to Ropsten, a live test network, with Infura API.
- checking deployment with [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/).
- creating a Token contract and the associated front end.

## Hardhat commands

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
node scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
```
